# Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my personal website, hosted on david.tompkins.computer . It's not performant, but I like it.

## Overview

- Built with Next.js
- All assets generated using AI (mostly dalle2, some SD3, and I think 1 with Flux schnell. Audio is udio)

## Usage

The code in this repository is available for anyone to use or modify. Though, tbh it would be kind of weird if we had the same pirate themed website. 

## Questions

If you have any questions about the code, feel free to reach out. Also if you want to try building something together. Or if you want to talk about development. Or for any reason really.

Thanks for checking it out!
